                Data has never been more important than today. It can be difficult to keep track of this data, but Google Analytics makes it easy for you! 
            </p>
                <h2>Collecting all the data automatically</h2>
            <p>
                One of the reasons why you should use Google Analytics is that the tool will collect all the data automatically. 
                You only have to set up your Google Analytics account and link it with your website. After that Google Analytics 
                will automatically start to collect the visitor data for you. Google Analytics even prepares reports for you! 
                That’s how you can see an overview of all the automatically processed data. Google Analytics does all the work for you!

            <h2>Figure out why visitors are bouncing off your website</h2>
            <p>
                ‘Bounce rate’ is a Google Analytics term that determines the amount of visitors that leave your website without visiting any other pages. This is one of the most important measurable data topics on Google Analytics. The goal is to keep your bounce rate as low as possible. If your bounce rate is on the higher side it means that visitors cannot find the information they are looking for. The website might also not be attractive enough to stay at.
                Google Analytics will provide you a report with details about the pages with a high bounce rate. This will help you to find a way to reduce the percentage.

            <h2>Get to know your visitors better</h2>
            <p>
                Another important reason why you should use Google Analytics is that you can easily get to know your audience better. There are many different ways to see who your visitors are. For example by using Google Analytics you can see:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The visitor's gender</li>
                    <li>The age of your visitor</li>
                    <li>Where your visitor lives</li>
                    <li>How they came to your website</li>
                    <li>Their behavior</li>
                    <li>Which device they used</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>As you can read above, there are plenty of reasons to use Google Analytics to get the best out of your website. Almost 30 million websites are using the Google Analytics right now, so what are you waiting for?</p>
