            <p>
                This website is part of the Digital Marketing module. This module is part of the first year studies in the Communication degree. On this website we share our knowledge about Google Analytics which we have got familiar with this semester. Why we chose this topic is that we’re hungry for information about how to make a business successful! And what would be more relevant to that than being aware of the usage of your website?
