            <p>
                To get started with Google Analytics, head to the Google Analytics login page. When logging in with your Google account, the page will guide you through the needed settings. You will need to insert an account name of your choice as well as choose wether you want to track a website, mobile app or both. On the third step you have to type in the name of your website, website’s domain (e.g. arnhembusinessschool.com) and other information about your website. You can follow the steps with our Google Analytics tutorial below.
